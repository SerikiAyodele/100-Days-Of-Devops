* Git status: gives information on the current status of a git repository and it's content 
* Git init: to create a new git repository- creates a hidden .git folder
  * rm -rf .git: to remove a .git folder
* Each commit is like a snapshot or a checkpoint at a particular time, of your repo
* Working directory: where we actually work on our project
* Staging area: Where we add our changes to, before we make a commit
* Atomic commit: when possible, a commit should encompass a single feature, change or fix.
  This makes it easy to roll back changes later

* git log --abbrev-commit: will give you shorter info on the logs
* git log --pretty=oneline: is easier to read
