resource “aws_vpc” “my_vpc” {
	cidr_block = “10.0.0.0/12”

my_vpc: name we are giving the resource within terraform

Difference between list and tupleIn a list we can only specify one data type, in a tupule we can have multiple data types
Tuple is similar to list
Object is similar to Map
 
Tfswitch allows you to easily switch between versions of terraform
